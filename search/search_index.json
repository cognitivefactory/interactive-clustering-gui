The authors of the CeCILL-C license are: Commissariat \u00e0 l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical and industrial research establishment, having its principal place of business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France. Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific and technological establishment, having its principal place of business at 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16, France. Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique - INRIA, a public scientific and technological establishment, having its principal place of business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt, BP 105, 78153 Le Chesnay cedex, France. CeCILL stands for Ce(a) C(nrs) I(nria) L(ogiciel) L(ibre) Preamble \ufffd The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users the right to modify and re-use the software governed by this license. The exercising of this right is conditional upon the obligation to make available to the community the modifications made to the source code of the software so as to contribute to its evolution. In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability. In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or removed herefrom. This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

Initial Software: means the Software in its Source Code and possibly its Object Code form and, where applicable, its documentation, \"as is\" when it is first distributed under the terms and conditions of the Agreement. Modified Software: means the Software modified by at least one Integrated Contribution. Source Code: means all the Software's instructions and program lines to which access is required so as to modify the Software. Object Code: means the binary files originating from the compilation of the Source Code. Holder: means the holder(s) of the economic rights over the Initial Software. Licensee: means the Software user(s) having accepted the Agreement. Contributor: means a Licensee having made at least one Integrated Contribution. Licensor: means the Holder, or any other individual or legal entity, who distributes the Software under the Agreement. Integrated Contribution: means any or all modifications, corrections, translations, adaptations and/or new functions integrated into the Source Code by any or all Contributors. Related Module: means a set of sources files including their documentation that, without modification to the Source Code, enables supplementary functions or services in addition to those offered by the Software. Derivative Software: means any combination of the Software, modified or not, and of a Related Module. Parties: mean both the Licensee and the Licensor. These expressions may be used both in singular and plural form.
